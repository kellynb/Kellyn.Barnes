                    <h2>BrewTracker</h2>
                    <p> Before web development, I used to brew beer for a production brewery in Austin, TX. 
                        Most of the time, production goes smoothly. However sometimes things happen like operational hurdles from equipment malfunctions, employee errors, logistical or scheduling issues. 
                        To capture these moments, every data point was taken down with pen and paper which made it difficult to troubleshoot issues.
                        And not all team members were briefed on the root cause of a problem.
                        Therefore, to solve these these problems, I am in the process of building what I call a “BrewTracker.” 
                        The goal of BrewTracker is to have all employees informed on the state of each batch of beer and easily archive the information so it’s tracked historically. 
                        Having this kind of information should result in efficiencies and an overall better product. 
                        Below are screenshots of the app as well as a brief explanation of what each component does.

                            <p>
                                The home landing page is where the user can see a visual representation of each tank that is used for production. 
                                Data is fetched from a database displaying the current condition of a tank through various key visuals.
                                By clicking on the button, "UPDATE TANK", the user is directed to the Fermentation page of that tank.
                                Also, the user can navigate to brew a new batch of beer by selecting the "Brew Batch" button on the navigation bar. 
                            </p>
                        </div>     
                    </section>
                    <section class="brewSection changeSection">
                        <div class="pageDescription">
                            <h3 class="brewTitle">Brew Batch</h3>
                            <p>
                                After clicking on the “Brew Batch” button, the user is directed to this page. Here, the brewer inputs values that he/she tracks during the brewing process, which is then sent to a database. 
                                Since the brewing process can take anywhere from six to eight hours, the app uses a continuous timer to send data every 30 seconds until the brewing process is complete or if the brewer changes pages.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>
                                The user navigates here to make changes regarding the current status of the beer after its been brewed.
                                The color of the tank represents the current stage of the beer from fermenting, to cold conditioning, to empty. 
                                The form is populated with the most recent data inputted by the user.
                                The user can update the form and save data about the beer. After saving, the user will see the most recent beer metrics on the homepage and in the form.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </section>
                    <section id="finalInfo">
                        <div>
                            <h3 class="brewTitle">Future Versions</h3>
                            <p>
                                After all the main functionality is added to input and track a particular brew, I will then add a section called Historic Brews. 
                                In this section the user can pull up past batches and see all of the relevant metrics. 
                                Within this section, the plan is to have options to compare multiple batches graphically. 
                                Overall, I hope this gives you a good understanding of what I’m trying to achieve in order to have a consistent brew, time after time.
