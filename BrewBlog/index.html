                            <h2>BrewTracker</h2>
                            <p> During the week, I currently brew beer for a production brewery in Austin, TX.  
                                Most of the time, production goes smoothly. However on occasion, operational hurdles from equipment malfunctions, employee errors, logistical or scheduling issues require unique solutions and slight alterations to keep both production rolling and the beer consistent.  
                                During these times, not all operational employees get briefed on the incidents nor the solutions. 
                                And, records of corrective actions either aren’t recorded nor easy to find.  Therefore, to solve these two problems, I’m in the process of building BrewTracker.  
                                The goal is to have all employees informed on the state of each beer and easily archive each batch to prevent historical occurrences. Below are screenshots of the app as well as a brief explanation of what the component does.  
                            </p>

                                <h3 class="brewTitle">Homepage</h3>
                                <p> After the user logins in, the user can see a visual representation of each tank that is used for production. 
                                    Data is being fetched from the database displaying the current condition of a tank thru various key visuals. 
                                    Also, the user can navigate to brew a new batch of beer by selection the "Brew Batch" button.
                                </p>

                                <h3 class="brewTitle">Brew Batch</h3>
                                <p>After clicking on the “Brew Batch” button,  the user is directed to this page. Here,  the brewer inputs values that he/she tracks during the brew process which then is sent to the database. 
                                    Since the brew process can take anywhere from 6 to 8 hours, the app uses a continuous timer to send data every 30 seconds until the brew is done or if the brewer changes pages.
                                </p>

                                    <p>I'm currently working on this section; the fermentation tank.  The color of the tank represents the current stage of the beer from
                                            fermenting, to cold conditioning, to empty. The user can click on a tank to update the status of the batch which will alert all users.
                                    </p>
                            </div>

                                <h3 class="brewTitle">Future Versions</h3>
                                <p>After all the main functionality is added to input and track a brew, I will then add a section called Historic Brews.
                                In this section the user can pull up past batches and see all relevant metrics. Within this section, the plan is to have
                                options to compare multiple batches graphically. Also to manage data in React, I plan on implementing React Redux.
                                Overall, I hope this gives you a good understanding of what I’m trying to achieve.
